# Tmux mode sync
# ============================================================
# Disabled: we no longer switch tmux UI colors based on zsh vi-mode.
# (Mode is already clear in the editor, and color switching was too abrupt.)
#
# If you want to re-enable in the future, restore this file from git history.
